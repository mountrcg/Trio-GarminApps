# Garmin apps for Trio

The repository contains the watchface and Datafields for Garmin usable with Trio. they are [available in connectIQ](https://apps.garmin.com/de-DE/developer/eae8d754-7a90-4cc7-85f1-95d12ea93490/apps)

The apps requires a large PR applied to Trio, which is not yet done. In the meanwhile you can use the branch [feat/Garmin from my Trio](https://github.com/mountrcg/Trio/tree/feat/garmin) repo or the [Tai dev](https://github.com/mountrcg/tai/tree/Tai-dev) branch.
